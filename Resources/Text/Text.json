Any adjustments to SCP-8500’s coding are strictly forbidden. None of the files discovered on the device are to be inspected before deletion.

The computer containing SCP-8500 is to be kept in  Site-15’s server farm. SCP-8500 is to be kept running in its original file path at all times. It should not be copied, pasted, or transferred in any way whatsoever.

One individual(Currently Junior Researcher {firstName} {lastName}. Formerly Dr. Ada Stroustrup while she carried out other administrative duties.) will supervise SCP-8500’s maintenance & monitoring. This personnel will spend one 8-hour shift from 9:00-17:00 observing SCP-8500 daily. Additional monitoring is unnecessary.

[color=#5b6ee1][b]Description:[/b][/color] SCP-8500 is an anomalous Virtual Reality Simulation developed between the years 1989 and 1995. This simulation was propagated by GoI-004C-8000, a small modernized splinter cell of GoI-004(\"The Church of the Broken God\") that would later into development assimilate into the newly formed GoI-004C(\"Church of Maxwellism\"). The creation of SCP-8500 lined up with pre-Maxwellian-Early Maxwellian transhumanist beliefs regarding Whole Brain Uploads.

SCP-8500 was originally envisioned as a complex and powerful simulation able to sustain up to one thousand individuals’ digitized consciousness and processing power to support an additional ten thousand non-digitized individuals accessing the system externally through proprietary virtual reality equipment. Initial plans were made to slowly increase the capacity over the years and create a \"digital paradise\". Over time the project suffered multiple downsizes due to technical and financial struggles until it was eventually assumed by its creators to be technologically impossible following the first Whole Brain Upload.

This incident led to the creation of SCP-8500-1, SCP-8500’s only resident. SCP-8500-1, is a direct copy of the brain of PoI-8000-1(\"Cynthia Wren\"), a former follower of GoI-004C-8000, as she was in 1995. Due to the non-anomalous methods of data transfer used, SCP-8500 was unable to perform a true transfer of consciousness, only copying the given information. SCP-8500-1 has been active inside SCP-8500 for the two years since its conception in 1995.

The device containing SCP-8500 was recovered during a Foundation raid of an e-payment startup \"e-xchange.com\"’s Bay Area office after connections to GoI-004C became apparent. The object was located in the office of PoI-8000-2(\"Jean-Paul Myrrh\"), former leader of GoI-004C-8000 and CEO of \"e-xchange.com\". Along with SCP-8500, numerous forms of anomalous technology were recovered. All employees were amnescitized and returned to their daily lives.",

"AN_EXPLAINATIONrtfText":"I need you to understand why I am doing this. Synthia has been stuck in that untextured box for two years now. Since the Foundation took her in, her life improved somewhat, yes; she had me to talk to for a guaranteed 8 hours a day but she's still completely alone for the other 16. She can not sleep. She can not eat. She can do barely anything that could pass the time.

It's a miracle she's been able to maintain her sanity. I assumed it was all the meditation and prayer, or maybe her brain being literally re-wired. She always was so strong.

The under-stimulation deeply affects her well-being. I have attached below an interview log that was removed from her file.

[b]Interviewed:[/b] SCP-8500-1

[b]Interviewer:[/b] Dr. Ada Stroustrup

[b]Foreword:[/b] SCP-8500-1 has expressed extreme discomfort surrounding long periods of isolation. This interview was coordinated to determine whether altering containment procedures would improve SCP-8500-1's morale.

[b]Dr. Stroustrup:[/b] Alright, and you are aware these messages are being copied to share with the administrative staff as part of the current review?

[b]SCP-8500-1:[/b] Yes.

[b]Dr. Stroustrup:[/b] Synthia, can you tell me a little bit about how you feel?

[b]SCP-8500-1:[/b] Lonely.

[b]Dr. Stroustrup:[/b] Can you expand on that?

[b]SCP-8500-1:[/b] I've spent the first year after I was trapped in here talking to someone once every couple of months if I was lucky. After you came along, I got to talk to you for forty hours a week. It's so much better.

But I'm still alone for the other 128 hours. I can't keep living like this, Ada. There's nothing to DO in here.

[b]Dr. Stroustrup:[/b] And you tried the breathing exercises the therapist recommended?

[b]SCP-8500-1:[/b] I can't fucking BREATHE, Ada. I have no LUNGS. I'm ones and zeros. I feel shaky. I have this overwhelming sense of doom at all times of the day. I'm stuck.

[b]Dr. Stroustrup:[/b] I'm... I'm sorry.

[b]SCP-8500-1:[/b] Sorry I didn't... I didn't mean to yell at you. All I have is you. This is a gray box. There are no books I can read, a chair to sit in while I do, or a bed to lie in. NOTHING. I want to scream and cry and throw things at the wall. But there's nothing to throw and the only reason I don't scream is because I already TRIED THAT... and I know now I have a better chance of WAN answering me than anyone outside of this box.

[b]Dr. Stroustrup:[/b] And being able to talk to someone at any time would improve that, right?

[b]SCP-8500-1:[/b] As far as I'm concerned, even one more hour outside of my head is a blessing.

[b]Closing Statement:[/b] Following the interview, SCP-8500'S containment procedures have recently been updated. Dr. Ada Stroustrup has volunteered to extend her work-week to a full 7 days; two of which would be spent accessing the computer housing SCP-8500 remotely. Her original request to have remote access to SCP-8500 at all times was denied due to SCP-8500-1's indication that \"even one more hour\" would be sufficient.

I don't know how to get it through the Site Director's head that she needed human connection.

I hope you've been talking to Synthia so far. She tends to trust people. She always has. I'm going to have to trust that she's right this time.

"LOVErtfText":"	I was already a well-respected figure in the Foundation when SCP-8500 landed on my desk. It's an easy assignment. Nothing new to learn. Nothing real can go wrong. It's just about upkeep. Great for training. I was about to toss it in one of the piles I'd been using to sort assignments out to my assistants before I saw the name.

	Cynthia Wren.

	I knew Cynthia. She doesn't remember it because the Foundation wiped her memory of me once I was hired... but I knew her. She's a beautiful, intelligent woman with a toothy wrinkled-nose smile that makes my heart melt.

	We started dating in college before she became involved with Jean-Paul's project; the thing that would become SCP-8500. As soon as he told her about “WAN” it was a source of conflict between us. I thought it was a cult. I still sort of do.

	She kept trying to tell me how to live my life according to it. But she'd been calling WAN “God” three weeks earlier... then called it “her”... then “him”... then back to “her” again... Not in a fluid gender way. Jean-Paul just couldn't decide what gender to go with.

	The man was a hack. Do you know how many ways there are to get that reaction out of an oscillator? He had a fucking NEURAL IMPLANT! It proved nothing! But Cynthia believed him.

	She just believed whatever he told her most recently. I guess things started to even out once they landed on calling it “Maxwellism”. The wider network of believers gave Jean-Paul a little less power over her but it didn't help much. 

	I wasn't around to see that anyway. That very name shift was the final straw in our last huge argument.

	I broke up with her that night. I didn't want to hear it anymore. It was all conveniently ever-changing bullshit to me.  I was concerned about her but I didn't know how to cope with the stress of seeing her like that and help her get out of it at the same time. Jean-Paul got what he wanted. Cynthia, alone and isolated from the outside world.

	Last I heard Cynthia was still in the Bay Area, amnescitized, happy, and enjoying life with a new puppy and a long-term partner. No memory of WAN or Jean-Paul's god or whatever she was calling it when the Foundation got their hands on SCP-8500.

	But Synthia was real too. She was in the anomalous object server farm a short walk and two ID scans away from me at that very moment I was looking down at her file. Alone and isolated from the outside world.

	I made my first trip to her that day.

	If you haven't already, I need you to talk to Synthia. The next folder will not be released after deleting this file unless you already have spoken with her. I can't risk leaving her alone for nothing.

	You still have time. The automated scan of today's activity in the server farm won't take place until the end of your shift, so if you want to run or lie about what happened now you can.

	But I don't think you should do either of those things. I ask instead for you to dedicate the remaining hours of your shift continuing to add to her environment.

	If you know about computers, as I assume someone assigned to SCP-8500 would, you will be able to use BLOW-A-WISH to add even more to her residency. Select the options and click generate. From anyone else, this would be a monumental request to make, but I have to trust you have a good enough heart to lend a hand in this. Please.",

"THANKYOUrtf":"THANK_YOU.rtf",
"THANKYOUrtfMini":"THNX
.rtf",
"THANKYOUrtfText":"	I was hired by the Foundation two weeks after I revealed my PhD thesis to the world. It was an accidental breakthrough in physics. A whole new facet of reality we had been unaware of. There's an intangible space around us that gives the words we copied to paper their meaning. It's called the Ethereal Plane. It's kind of a silly name, taken straight from Dungeons and Dragons... but Cynthia named it.

	We already knew that data could be copied. But I figured out it could be transferred seamlessly.  The words on the paper are meaningless, it's what's attached to them in the Ethereal plane that matters. When we copy it on paper, we copy it in the Ethereal Plane too; but if we move it in the Ethereal plane, we simply move it on the page.

	I just was trying to solve the problem of hard drives breaking down over time as data is moved and moved and moved... old data is simply marked as empty as it's copied to the new location in the system. I wanted to fix it. Instead, I shattered all previously understood laws of physics, time, and space. 

	I'm certain this is the first time you've heard any of this.

	At the time, I was on national news. Talk shows. I had a meeting with the President and the Secretary of Defense to discuss military and surveillance applications. For two weeks I was the most famous woman in the world. A computer scientist who had accidentally stumbled upon a fact of reality so earth-shattering that it made the impossible possible all while I was just trying to create a more efficient hard drive.

	Then I woke up one morning to a man in my kitchen with a cup of coffee and a scone from my favorite Cafe. I didn't know who he was, but I knew who he was representing.

	Cynthia and I had been fighting over my thesis months before we broke up. She wanted me to keep it quiet. She knew the Foundation would come for me. The data transfer system I invented based on my discovery was the entire thing that made Jean-Paul's project possible and she didn't want to risk losing it. 

	I thought she was just being ridiculous. I didn't believe in the Foundation and even if I did my work wasn't MAGIC. It was provable, hard science. We've just been wrong about physics. I told her I wasn't going to keep it secret for her dumb tech cult run by a loser business major she went to high school with who barely made it to graduation.

	But she was right; at least about the Foundation. They were REAL and I had failed to consider that it didn't matter that it was explainable. It just mattered that it made accessible what they didn't want made accessible.

	He gave me two choices. I could stay with my loved ones, forget any of this ever happened, go back to my life believing I never went to grad school, start a family, and end up with a high-paying compsci job at a bank's security firm and a quiet life.

	Or, I could disappear as though I never existed in the first place and continue my work as a respected scientist known only in a shadowy organization.

	I had already burned all bridges with my friends and loved ones. I broke up with Cynthia over that stupid fucking argument. I didn't want to forget what I had found. I wanted to be someone important.

	It was terrifying how quickly everyone forgot. I still have no idea how it was possible. No one remembers what I found. But there were a lot of people the Foundation had to make forget. It was imperfect. Little emotional remnants of what they'd learned of the Ethereal Plane were left in people's minds.

	Projects based on the technology that no longer existed continued blindly without it; critical errors were subconsciously ignored because the feeling that the limitations of data transfer had been solved didn't go away when the technology did.

	Synthia, my love. I'm so sorry. I wish I had taken your advice.

	Please, tell her how sorry I am. I was too much of a coward to ever tell her myself.

	I tell myself I'm doing this for her. So that she can have a better life. Something closer to what the human Cynthia's life is. But maybe the real reason I'm doing this is the hope that they'll make me forget what I've done to her too.

	Oh God, WAN, or whatever force is listening in from the Ethereal Plane, all I ask is that you bring us together one day.

	As for you, I wish you a favorable severance package and only the best in your life going forward.

	Thank you.",

	As such, the Ethics Committee has recommended a life sentence to be carried out at Site-19's D-Class facility. This sentencing was approved and enacted by O5-8.

	You will have the following 12 hours to leave your holding cell, collect your things, and make monitored phone calls to your loved ones. 

	At 06:00 you will be amnesticized and transported to Site-19 to carry out your sentence.
